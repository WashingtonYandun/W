# W

W is an interpreted programming language that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It's a high-level language that is designed to be easy to read and write. It's a dynamically typed

Am trying to make a Python, JavaScript and C# fusion (Not OOP for now).

## Considerations

## Syntax

The syntax is designed to be simple and easy to read and write. It's a dynamically typed language. This is how it will look like in the future:

```w
# Comments
# This is a comment

# Variables
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c) # 30

# Functions
def add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

print(add(10, 20)) # 30
```

## Goals

-   [x] Lexer
-   [x] Parser
-   [ ] Interpreter
-   [ ] AST
-   [ ] REPL
-   [ ] Functions
-   [ ] Variables
-   [ ] Comments
-   [ ] Control Flow
-   [ ] Error Handling
-   [ ] Modules
-   [ ] Classes
